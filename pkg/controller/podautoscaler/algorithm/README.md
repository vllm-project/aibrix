## Autoscaling Algorithms


This package provides various scaling algorithms for Pod Autoscaling,
including implementations for
- APA (Adaptive Pod Autoscaler),
- KPA (KNative Pod Autoscaler),
- HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), and more.

These algorithms are designed to dynamically compute the desired number of replicas based on current pod usage and scaling specifications,
optimizing resource usage and ensuring high availability and performance for workloads.

`ScalingAlgorithm Interface` is a common interface for all scaling algorithms, requiring the implementation of the `ComputeTargetReplicas` method,
which calculates the number of replicas based on current metrics and scaling specifications.

```go
type ScalingAlgorithm interface {
    ComputeTargetReplicas(currentPodCount float64, context ScalingContext) int32
}
```
