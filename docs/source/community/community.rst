Becoming a Maintainer
---------------------

We appreciate contributors who consistently help improve AIBrix. If you’ve been actively contributing, consider becoming a **Maintainer** — a role with broader responsibilities and deeper involvement in the project.

What is a Maintainer?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maintainers play a key role in keeping AIBrix healthy and growing. They help with:

- Reviewing and merging Pull Requests
- Triaging issues and managing labels
- Shaping the project roadmap and priorities
- Supporting new contributors and community members
- Ensuring code quality and consistency across the codebase

Promotion Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We promote contributors to maintainers based on merit and sustained contribution. Here's what we look for:

- **Consistent Contributions**: You’ve submitted several high-quality PRs (code or docs) that have been merged.
- **Helpful Reviews**: You’ve reviewed and commented constructively on other contributors' PRs.
- **Community Engagement**: You actively participate in GitHub issues, Slack discussions, or RFC reviews.
- **Responsibility and Ownership**: You demonstrate initiative in identifying problems and proposing improvements.

There is no strict rule on the number of contributions — we evaluate holistically.

How to Become a Maintainer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you meet the above criteria and are interested in taking on the maintainer role:

1. Let us know! You can:

   - Open a GitHub discussion or issue to express interest.
   - Reach out to existing maintainers in Slack `#AIBrix <https://vllm-dev.slack.com/archives/C08EQ883CSV>`_ or by `maintainers@aibrix.ai <maintainers@aibrix.ai>`_ .

2. We'll initiate a lightweight evaluation based on your recent contributions, engagement, and readiness to take on responsibilities.

3. Once approved, we'll:

   - Grant you write access to the repository.
   - Add you to the `@aibrix-maintainers` team.
   - Invite you to internal roadmap discussions if applicable.

4. Open source is a marathon, not a sprint. If you ever need to step back temporarily or permanently:

   - Just let us know — no hard feelings.
   - You can always return when you're ready.

Thank you for helping us grow AIBrix together!
