## Deploy EIC
You can visit the official link https://console.volcengine.com/eic and deploy EIC KVCache on your compute cluster with web UI.In addition, we provide particular image in volcano engine, which integrates various optimizations based on the official image.
You may use test_unit.py to detect the connectivity of EIC.



## Deploy Model With EIC
You can enable EIC KVCache offload with the official interface, such as

```bash
export AIBRIX_KV_CACHE_OL_L2_CACHE_BACKEND="EIC"

python3 -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
  ... \
  --kv-transfer-config '{"kv_connector":"AIBrixOffloadingConnectorV1Type3", "kv_role":"kv_both"}'
```
